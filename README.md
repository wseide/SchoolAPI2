# SchoolAPI
### By Wismy Seide

An API for NJIT would be used to support the university for several reasons.  It can give potential users new reasons to interact with the school.  Also, it can connect on a personal level as it helps users share experiences with others.  An API interface can help developers perform new uses with the data given.  For example, an API that released grades by classes can help determine what departments should be prioritized.  Does one department need more funding to increase student grades, or more grants to focus on student learning can be answered with an API that took that data and made it more presentable.

The school business operations could also be improved.  Information can be provided to accurate data that could be used to pull information quickly and with minor errors.  An API for a course registration could see how many students attempted to register for a course.  This data could be given to the faculty to open up more classes for that popular course.  Students who take courses in subjects they are interested in could increase grades and interaction. That same data can start clubs, scholarships, and more resources to make a university more viable.

Finally, the API can create a mobile application that students and faculty can use on the go.  Having that data in their phone, being accessible 24/7, is essential for those studying abroad, traveling, and those who do not have access to laptops or computers.  API can be used for data processing, organizing, integration, and security for student information.  Being able to provide retrieval functionalities would make an API suitable for any school or university.
